# Full-Stack Web Application for Performing Analysis Jobs on NOAA Time-Series Dataset

## Description

The software stack provided in this directory was used to develop and deploy a full-stack web 
application that enabled the performance of analysis jobs on a provided NOAA time-series dataset in an HPC cluster. 

The stack was packaged into a Docker container and pushed to DockerHub where it is accessible
[here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jcam989/final-project-prod)

The docker container was designed to be deployed on a specific Kubernetes cluster in an HPC environment
provided by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) and therefore is not for general-purpose use.
